# PongPvP

This was a code along project I did to introduce myself to pygame and further my understanding on defining, calling and nesting multiple functions. Aswell as improving my ability to reuse code rather than create unnecessary functions and keeping the workspace clean. This code along also introduced me to the object-oriented coding.
